ui states
  default
    drag canvas to pan
    mousedown on component to select
  component selected
    show arrow handles
  component being resized/rotated
  definition selected to create (show it at "natural" scale, semi-transparent (ghost), translating with mouse)


ui things
  definition shown on screen
  component being edited
  definition hovered
  definition (in bottom row) hovered


each svg will keep
  a class that says what definition it is (might be several)

some will keep
  a class that says which object it is


ui concepts
  hover: applies to definitions, slight glow?, consistent throughout the interface at all levels to show instances of a definition
    how does it apply to nested definitions in the viewport?
      maybe the first level applies all the way down
      that is, on hover go up the tree to the first level, then highlight anything of that definition
  selected: applies to components, highlight the arrow, show handles (circles) on the arrow
    to check: check that it's the object and that the depth == 1 (first level)
  editing: the definition currently in the viewport (root of viewport renderTree), only needs to be indicated in the bottom row with "Editing..."
    click on "Edit" to choose a different one (plus arrow key shortcut?)
